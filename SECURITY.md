We should get back to you within a week. If the vulnerability is qTox specific
and accepted, there should be a new release addressing the vulnerability within
a couple of weeks. If we disagree with the vulnerability analysis, we will
answer explaining our reasoning.

If the vulnerability is related to a dependency of qTox, we will follow the
disclosure policy of that project. If a fix from the project isn't imminent and
it's possible, we will mitigate the issue in qTox.
